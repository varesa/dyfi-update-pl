RUNNING:
	
    dyfi-update.pl -f <configfile>     (recommended)

OR:

    dyfi-update.pl -u <username> -p <password> -i <pidfile> [-l <logfile>]
        [-d] hostname1.dy.fi hostname2.dy.fi ...


  If no logfile is specified, log messages are printed on standard output.
Specify the -d option to produce a very verbose debugging log which
describes every action taken. 

  dyfi-update.pl is a daemon. You do not need to run it periodically
from cron - just run it in the background and it will do the job.

  dyfi-update.pl does not need root privileges run. Of course you need
to be able to write to the log & pid files, and read the config file.
The pid file is a mandatory option - the file is used to make sure that
no more than one copy of the script is run by accident. It is also
used by the /etc/init.d/dyfi-update script to stop the client.


INSTALLATION:

  To install the client, run 'make install'. This will install the
client script in /usr/local/bin. If a configuration file does not
exist in /etc/dyfi-update.conf, it will install a sample
file there. It will also install a systemd service file in /etc/systemd/system.

  Next, edit /etc/dyfi-update.conf to put your dy.fi config
in there.

  Then, try to start the service 'systemctl start dyfi-update'.
If there are any problems in the configuration, it should barf on the
console, or the log file you have configured (by default,
/var/log/dyfi-update.log). You can also stop the client using
'systemctl stop dyfi-update'.

  Do not put dyfi-update.pl in cron. It is a daemon.

  If you want dyfi-update.pl to automatically start up when the
machine is booting use 'systemctl enable dyfi-update'


UNINSTALLING:

  Run 'make uninstall'. This will clear the files installed by the
above commands from the default locations - including the
configuration file!

Have fun!
